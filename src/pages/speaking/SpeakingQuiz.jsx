            <br />
            I'm pleased to talk with you today. My name is Chris Martin, I come from the United Kingdom, and currently, I
            reside in London. I graduated from University College London with a degree in Ancient World Studies. I work as a
            musician and lead vocalist for the band Coldplay, and I truly enjoy my job because it allows me to express my
            creativity and connect with people through music. Outside of work, I like practicing mindfulness and meditation,
            which helps me relax and find balance in life.

            <span className="font-bold">2. How Would you Describe The City You Live in?</span>
            <br />I live in London, which is quite fascinating. It's a densely populated city, but at the same time, it has a
            dynamic urban life and many tourist attractions. One thing I like about this city is the diverse cultural events
            and festivals that always provide opportunities for socializing and exploration.
